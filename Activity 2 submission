Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge! 🎭
Create a program that includes animals or vehicles with the same action (like move()).
However, make each class define move() differently (for example, Car.move() prints "Driving" 🚗, while Plane.move() prints "Flying" ✈️).


class Vehicle:
    def move(self):
        raise NotImplementedError("Subclasses must implement this method")

class Car(Vehicle):
    def move(self):
        return "Driving 🚗"

class Plane(Vehicle):
    def move(self):
        return "Flying ✈️"

class Boat(Vehicle):
    def move(self):
        return "Sailing ⛵"

class Bicycle(Vehicle):
    def move(self):
        return "Pedaling 🚲"

car = Car()
plane = Plane()
boat = Boat()
bicycle = Bicycle()

vehicles = [car, plane, boat, bicycle]

for vehicle in vehicles:
    print(vehicle.move())
